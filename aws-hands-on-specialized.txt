MUST HAVE - Real Hands-On experience with AWS
GOOD TO HAVE - AWS Certified Developer, SysOps & DevOps Professional to gain some hands-on experience
The course is MOSTLY SLIDES-BASED: If you're new to AWS, just finished AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and need to acquire some hands-on experience, I strongly recommend doing the following courses: AWS Certified Developer Associate, AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate, AWS Certified DevOps Engineer.
Expert course - you MUST have AT LEAST the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate: a lot of pre-requisite knowledge is assumed for that course. If you don't feel confident, please review the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate course first. Other certifications and extra-hands on experience is a huge plus.
The AWS Certified Security Specialty certification is a fun certification and a challenging exam. It requires some substantial hands-on and real-world experience for you to pass. This course is going to help you solidify the knowledge you already have and put it in perspective through the study of various solutions architectures and services.
With AWS becoming the centerpiece of today's modern IT architectures, I have decided it is time for students to learn how to be an AWS Security Specialty expert. So, let’s kick start the course! You are in good hands!
